### 📌 Project Description

This **Loan Management System** is a secure, full-stack web application designed to digitize and automate the complete loan lifecycle — from online application to EMI payment and loan closure. It is built using **ASP.NET Core Web API** for the backend, **Angular** for the frontend, and **SQL Server** as the database, ensuring a fast, scalable, and reliable financial platform.

The system follows a **role-based access model** with three primary user roles: **Admin, Loan Officer, and Customer**, each having dedicated dashboards and permissions secured through **JWT authentication**.

Customers can apply for loans online, track application status (Pending/Approved/Rejected), view EMI schedules, make EMI payments, and download payment receipts directly from their dashboard. Real-time loan status updates and transaction history provide transparency and ease of use.

Loan Officers are responsible for reviewing loan applications, verifying customer details, approving or rejecting requests, monitoring EMI schedules, analyzing repayment reports, and tracking overdue payments. This streamlines the verification process and improves operational efficiency.

Administrators manage the overall system, including approving loan officer registrations, configuring loan types with interest rates, tenure limits, and borrowing limits, and monitoring system-wide loan performance through interactive analytical dashboards. Admins also maintain system security, notifications, and user role management.

The platform includes **automated EMI calculation**, centralized repayment tracking, downloadable receipts, system notifications, and real-time analytical dashboards, ensuring transparency, accountability, and improved decision-making.

This project demonstrates a modern digital banking solution that reduces manual processing, minimizes errors, enhances customer experience, and provides a scalable foundation for real-world financial applications.
